Use [jenkinsci/ec2-fleet-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-fleet-plugin) instead of [awslabs/ec2-spot-jenkins-plugin](https://github.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-jenkins-plugin)


The EC2 Fleet Plugin launches EC2 Spot or On Demand instances as worker nodes for Jenkins CI server, 
automatically scaling the capacity with the load.

# Overview

This plugin uses [EC2 Spot Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html) or [Auto Scaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html) to launch instances instead of directly launching them by itself. 
Both maintain your fleet's target capacity as Spot prices change to maintain
the fleet within the specified price range. For more information, see 
[How Spot Fleet Works](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html).

# Features

- Support EC2 Spot Fleet or Auto Scaling Group as Jenkins Workers
- Supports all features provided by EC2 Spot Fleet or Auto Scaling Groups
- Auto resubmit failed jobs caused by Spot interruptions
- No delay scale up strategy: enable ```No Delay Provision Strategy``` in configuration
- Add tags to EC2 instances used by plugin, for easy search, tag format ```ec2-fleet-plugin:cloud-name=<MyCloud>```
- Allow custom EC2 API endpoint
- Auto Fleet creation based on Job label ([details](docs/LABEL-BASED-CONFIGURATION.md))

## Comparison to EC2-Plugin

[EC2-Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2/) is a similar Jenkins plugin that will request EC2 instances when excess jobs are
detected. The main difference between the two plugins is that EC2-Fleet-Plugin uses EC2 Spot Fleet and ASG to request and manage
instances instead of doing it manually with EC2 RunInstances. This gives EC2-Fleet-Plugin all the benefits of Spot Fleet and ASG:
allocation strategies, automatic availability zone rebalancing (ASG only), access to launch configurations and launch templates
, instance weighting, etc. 

| EC2-Fleet-Plugin | EC2-Plugin |
| --- | --- |
| Supports On-Demand & Spot Instances | Supports On-Demand & Spot Instances |
| Scales with EC2 Spot Fleet or ASG | Scales with RunInstances |
| EC2 Spot Fleet and ASG Allocation Strategies | No Allocation Strategies |
| Use launch config/template to set instance settings | Manually set instances settings within plugin |
| Custom instance weighting | No custom instance weighting |

# Change Log

This plugin is using [SemVersion](https://semver.org/) which means that each plugin version looks like 
```
<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>

major = increase only if non back compatible changes
minor = increase when new features
bugfix = increase when bug fixes
```

As a result, you can safely update the plugin to any version until the first number is different than what you have.

# Usage

## Setup

#### 1. Create AWS Account

Go to [AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and follow instructions.

#### 2. Create IAM User

Specify ```programmatic access``` during creation and record the credentials. These will
be used by Jenkins EC2 Fleet Plugin to connect to your Spot Fleet.

*Alternatively, you may use [AWS EC2 instance roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html)*

#### 3. Configure User permissions

Add an inline policy to the IAM user or EC2 instance role to allow it to use EC2 Spot Fleet and Auto Scaling Group.
[AWS documentation about this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#spot-fleet-prerequisites)

   ]
}
```

#### 4. Create EC2 Fleet / Auto-Scaling Group

*Create EC2 Spot Fleet*

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#create-spot-fleet

Make sure that you:
- Check ```Maintain target capacity``` [why](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-configuration-strategies.html#ec2-fleet-request-type)
- Specify an SSH key that will be used later by Jenkins.

*Alternatively, create an Auto Scaling Group*

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/GettingStartedTutorial.html

#### 5. Configure Jenkins

Once the Spot Fleet or ASG is ready, you can use it by adding a new **EC2 Fleet** cloud in the Jenkins configuration.

1. Goto ```Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager```
1. Install ```EC2 Fleet Jenkins Plugin```
1. Goto ```Manage Jenkins > Configure System```
1. Click ```Add a new cloud``` and select ```Amazon EC2 Fleet```
1. Configure AWS credentials, or leave empty to use the EC2 instance role
1. Specify EC2 Spot Fleet or Auto Scaling Group which you want to use

More information on the configuration options can be found [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-fleet-plugin/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION-OPTIONS.md).

## Scaling
You can specify the scaling limits in your cloud settings. By default, Jenkins will try to scale the fleet up
if there are enough tasks waiting in the build queue and scale down idle nodes after a specified idleness period.

You can use the History tab in the AWS console to view the scaling history.

## Groovy

Below is a Groovy script to setup EC2 Spot Fleet Plugin for Jenkins and configure it. You can
run the script with [Jenkins Script Console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Script+Console).

## Preconfigure Slave

Sometimes you need to prepare a slave (an EC2 instance) before Jenkins can use it.
For example, you need to install some software which is required by your builds like Maven, etc.

For those cases you have a few options, described below:

### Amazon EC2 AMI

[AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) allows you to 
create custom images for your EC2 instances. For example, you can create an image with
Linux plus Java, Maven etc. Then, when EC2 Fleet launches new EC2 instances with
this AMI they will automatically get all the required software. Nice =)

1. Create a custom AMI as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html#creating-an-ami)
1. Create EC2 Spot Fleet with this AMI

### EC2 Instance User Data

EC2 instances allow you to specify a [User Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html)
script that is executed when an instance first launches. This allows you to customize the setup for a particular instance.

#### SSH Prefix Verification

EC2 instances don't provide any information about the User Data script execution status,
so Jenkins could start a task on a new instance while the script is still in progress. Most of the time Jenkins will
repeatedly try to connect to the instance during this time and print out errors until the script completes and Jenkins
can connect.

To avoid those errors, you can use the Jenkins SSH Launcher ```Prefix Start Agent Command``` setting
to specify a command which should fail if User Data is not finished. In that way Jenkins will
not be able to connect to the instance until the User Data script is done. More information on configuring the SSH
launcher can be found [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ssh-slaves-plugin/blob/master/doc/CONFIGURE.md).

1. Open Jenkins
1. Go to ```Manage Jenkins > Configure System```
1. Find proper fleet configuration and click ```Advanced...``` for SSH Launcher
1. Add checking command into field ```Prefix Start Slave Command```
   - example ```java -version && ```
1. To apply for existing instances, restart Jenkins or Delete Nodes from Jenkins so they will be reconnected

sudo yum install java-1.8.0 -y
sudo yum remove java-1.7.0-openjdk -y
java -version
