The EC2 Spot Jenkins plugin launches EC2 Spot instances as worker nodes for Jenkins CI server, 
automatically scaling the capacity with the load.

# Overview
This plugin uses Spot Fleet to launch instances instead of directly launching them by itself. 
Amazon EC2 attempts to maintain your Spot fleet's target capacity as Spot prices change to maintain
the fleet within the specified price range. For more information, see 
[How Spot Fleet Works](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html).

# Features

- Supports all features provided by EC2 Spot Fleet
- Auto resubmit Jobs failed because of Spot Interruption
- Allow no delay scale up strategy, enable ```No Delay Provision Strategy``` in configuration
- Add tags to EC2 instances used by plugin, for easy search, tag format ```ec2-fleet-plugin:cloud-name=<MyCloud>```
- Allow custom EC2 API endpoint

# Change Log

This plugin is using [SemVersion](https://semver.org/) which means that each plugin version looks like 
```
<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>

major = increase only if non back compatible changes
minor = increase when new features
bugfix = increase when bug fixes
```

As result you safe to update plugin to any version until first number is the same with what you have.

# Usage

## Setup

#### 1. Get AWS Account

[AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

#### 2. Create IAM User

Specify ```programmatic access``` during creation, and record credentials 
which will be used by Jenkins EC2 Fleet Plugin to connect to your Spot Fleet
 
#### 3. Configure User permissions

Add inline policy to the user to allow it use EC2 Spot Fleet 
[AWS documentation about that](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#spot-fleet-prerequisites)

```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "ec2:*"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                "iam:ListRoles",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfiles"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
```

#### 4. Create EC2 Spot Fleet

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#create-spot-fleet

Make sure that you:
- Checked ```Maintain target capacity``` [why](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-configuration-strategies.html#ec2-fleet-request-type)
- specify an SSH key that will be used later by Jenkins.

#### 5. Configure Jenkins

Once the fleet is launched, you can set it up by adding a new **EC2 Fleet** cloud in the Jenkins

1. Goto ```Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager``` 
1. Install ```EC2 Fleet Jenkins Plugin```
1. Goto ```Manage Jenkins > Configure System```
1. Click ```Add a new cloud``` and select ```Amazon SpotFleet```
1. Configure credentials and specify EC2 Spot Fleet which you want to use

## Scaling
You can specify the scaling limits in your cloud settings. By default, Jenkins will try to scale fleet up
if there are enough tasks waiting in the build queue and scale down idle nodes after a specified idleness period.

You can use the History tab in the AWS console to view the scaling history. 

## Groovy

Below Groovy script to setup EC2 Spot Fleet Plugin for Jenkins and configure it, you can
run it by [Jenkins Script Console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Script+Console)

```

## Preconfigure Slave

Sometimes you need to prepare slave (which is EC2 instance) before Jenkins could use it.
For example install some software which will be required by your builds like Maven etc.

For those cases you have a few options, described below:

### Amazon EC2 AMI

**Greate for static preconfiguration**

[AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) allows you to 
create custom images for your EC2 instances. For example you can create image with
Linux plus Java, Maven etc. as result when EC2 fleet will launch new EC2 instance with
this AMI it will automatically get all required software. Nice =)

1. Create custom AMI as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html#creating-an-ami)
1. Create EC2 Spot Fleet with this AMI

### EC2 instance User Data

EC2 instance allows to specify special script [User Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html)
which will be executed when EC2 instance is created. That's allow you to do some customization
for particular instance.

However, EC2 instance doesn't provide any information about User Data execution status,
as result Jenkins could start task on new instances while User Data still in progress.

To avoid that you can use Jenkins SSH Launcher ```Prefix Start Agent Command``` setting
to specify command which should fail if User Data is not finished, in that way Jenkins will
not be able to connect to instance until User Data is not done [more](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ssh-slaves-plugin/blob/master/doc/CONFIGURE.md)

1. Prepare [User Data script](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html)
1. Open Jenkins
1. Goto ```Manage Jenkins > Configure Jenkins```
1. Find proper fleet configuration and click ```Advance``` for SSH Launcher
1. Add checking command into field ```	Prefix Start Slave Command```
   - example ```java -version && ```
1. To apply for existent instances restart Jenkins or Delete Nodes from Jenkins so they will be reconnected
