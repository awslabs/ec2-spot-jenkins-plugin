If unchecked, plugin will resubmit the job if it failed due an instance termination. For example, after an
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">EC2 Spot instance interruption</a>.

If checked, auto resubmit will be disabled.

<p>
    Interrupted job will be shown as failed or aborted see pipeline notes below.
    While copy will be submitted into jenkins queue to execute or any possible node.
</p>

<p>
    Parametrized job will be resubmitted with same parameters as defined for interrupted.
</p>

<p>
    In case if job is <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/">pipeline (workflow)</a> interrupted
    task will be aborted as workflow usually don't fail in case of node interruption and wait until
    node will be online. Plugin force job to abort and resubmit.
